# Frontend Frameworks

Feathers works the same on the server and on the client and is front-end framework agnostic. You can use it with Vue, React, React Native, Angular, or whatever other front-end tech stack you choose.

## Client Side Docs

If you want to learn how to use Feathers as a client in Node.js, React Native, or in the browser with a module loader like Webpack refer to the [client API docs](../api/client.md).

## The Feathers chat

The [Feathers Chat application](../guides/) from guide gives a basic intro to using the Feathers Client in a vanilla JavaScript environment. That's a good place to start to see how things fit together. Framework specific repositories can be found at:

- JavaScript + plain JS frontend: [docs-dev/feathers-chat](https://github.com/docs-dev/feathers-chat)
- TypeScript + plain JS frontend: [docs-dev/feathers-chat-ts](https://github.com/docs-dev/feathers-chat-ts)
- React: [docs-dev-ecosystem/feathers-chat-react](https://github.com/docs-dev-ecosystem/feathers-chat-react)
- React Native: [docs-dev-ecosystem/feathers-react-native-chat](https://github.com/docs-dev-ecosystem/feathers-react-native-chat)
- Angular: [docs-dev-ecosystem/feathers-chat-angular](https://github.com/docs-dev-ecosystem/feathers-chat-angular)
- VueJS with Vuex: [feathers-plus/feathers-chat-vuex](https://github.com/feathers-plus/feathers-chat-vuex)
